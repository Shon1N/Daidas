                    The course includes everything you will need to learn about acrylic nails. You will learn to produce the perfect combination of acrylic lyquid and powder and apply it to the different areas of the nail with a brush. By combining acrylic liquid
                    and powder a strong flexible overlay can be produced. This versatile overlay can be applied to the natural nail tip: it can also be sculpted over a form.

                    The course includes everything you need to learn about fibre/silk nails. This is the application process of sticky fibre/silk strips directly to the nail. Thin layers of resin are applied with the help of an activator to set the resin and make the fibre
                    wave invisible, and to strengthen and enhance the nail shape. Fibreglass overlays can be used over a tip or to strengthen the natural nail. It is an excellent remedy for broken or cracked nails as it provides a thin yet very strong coating.
                    As fibreglass is water resistant, it is a good choice for clients working with water or those who are allergic to UV gel or acrylic.
